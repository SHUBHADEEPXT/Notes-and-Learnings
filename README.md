# 📚 Notes and Learnings – My DevOps Journey

Welcome to my curated DevOps notes and learnings repository.  
This is a **handcrafted collection** of handwritten notes, personal project insights, and real-world DevOps examples — created as I transitioned from QA/Support to becoming a full-stack **DevOps Engineer**.

## ⭐️ Why I Built This

After leaving my support/QA role in early 2025, I committed myself fully to becoming a DevOps Engineer.  
This repo captures the **depth of learning**, the **struggles**, and the **solutions** I encountered — shared openly to help others and to keep myself accountable.

> "Knowledge becomes powerful when shared. These notes are my way of giving back."
