# 🌐 Networking Notes – DevOps Context
This folder contains my handwritten notes, diagrams, and real-world use cases related to **Networking fundamentals and practical implementations** for DevOps engineers.
🧠 What’s Inside:
- TCP/IP, OSI Layers, DNS, DHCP
- Subnetting, CIDR, and VPC concepts
- Load Balancers, NAT, Firewalls
- Kubernetes Networking (CNI, ClusterIP, NodePort, Ingress)
- Interview-ready questions with notes
📝 Format:
All notes are in image format — hand-drawn by me during revision and project planning.
Includes contextual examples from my project work and DevOps infrastructure.
🎯 Why This Matters:
Strong networking knowledge is crucial for debugging, designing resilient systems, and understanding how cloud-native apps communicate.
📌 Coming Soon:
- Mini labs with curl, netcat, ping, telnet
- Real-world network diagram examples
