# ⚙️ CI/CD Notes & Pipelines – DevOps Projects
This section captures everything I’ve learned about **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment**, with a hands-on and project-oriented approach.
🔍 Covered Topics:
- CI/CD concepts & lifecycle
- Jenkins Pipelines (Declarative & Scripted)
- GitHub Actions workflows with YAML
- Docker + Jenkins integration
- GitOps (ArgoCD Overview)
- Real-world CI/CD strategies (dev → staging → prod)
💡 Project Context:
Notes are based on my actual CI/CD implementations in:
- A full-stack Todo App (Docker + GitHub Actions + EKS)
- Monitoring Stack setup (Prometheus + Jenkins pipeline)
🛠️ Tools Used:
- Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes
- Git, Webhooks, ArgoCD, S3 (for artifacts)
🎓 Ideal For:
- Beginners building pipelines from scratch
- DevOps learners needing real use-case templates
- Interview prep with practical CI/CD system knowledge
📌 Coming Soon:
- Reusable GitHub Action templates
- Jenkinsfile snippets for pipelines
- ArgoCD deployment YAMLs
